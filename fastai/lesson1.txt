NN dont require us to build advanced features the NN's build it for us. 
	- the NN is asked to learn the features not given the features which is a more traditional stand. 

Start with a random neural network and give it things to learn. 

We don't have to handcode the features they can be learned by the neural netowrk. 

Image recognizer can also be used to classify sounds. 
i
Literally just feed in data to the Neural Netowrk -> is this even rewarding? 

Myths: 
	Lots of math
	Lots of data
	Lots of expensive computers

Pytorch
	- more popular than tensorflow

Bird or not bird model: 

DataBlock
	how to get the data into the model. 
	things that change
		the first thing is the type of input that you have which is block: image -> type, what is the output -> CategoryBlock one of a number of possibilities. 
		get_items represents the items of the model = get_image_files is a function that returns a list of all image files in the past. 
		splitter = set a validation set RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42), 
		get_y=parent_label how do we know the correct label of the photo, the parent_label is a function that returns the parent folder of a path, the two folders in ex were 'forest' 'bird'
		item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')] inputs need to be of the same size, two ways to either cropou a piece in the middle or squish it. 
		).dataloaders(path) things that pytorch iterates through to grab a bunch of your data, done through a GPU which can do 1000s of things at the same time, dataloader
		feeds training algorithm with a batch of your data at a time.
	dls.show_batch(max_n=6) shows you a batch of max_n data that will be passed with the label, which came from get_y function. 

Tweaking neural network architectures: 
	never comes up. 
	much like compilers and machine language that is never used.
